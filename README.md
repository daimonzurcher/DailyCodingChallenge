# DailyCodingChallenge

In an effort to continuously strengthen my coding skills, I will be doing Daily Coding Challenge Â®'s 2024 daily puzzles - starting 1/29/2024.
I will be using Python for these challenges.
I am open to help/criticism! Please let me know whenever my code is incorrect/inefficient in any way.

Happy coding!

I got a little distracted in the early-middle of February. Between interviewing for a new job (and getting an offer!!!) and some other life events
going on, I didn't prioritize the time it takes to code each day.
