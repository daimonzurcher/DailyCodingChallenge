# DailyCodingChallenge

In an effort to continuously practice coding, I will be doing Daily Coding Challenge Â®'s 2024 daily puzzles - starting 1/30/2024.
I will be using Python for these challenges.
I am open to criticism! Please let me know whenever my code is incorrect/inefficient in any way.

Happy coding!
